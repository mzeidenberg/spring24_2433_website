## Course Topics

Database system architecture. Modeling an application and logical database design. The relational model and relational data definition and data manipulation languages. Design of relational databases and normalization theory. Physical database design. Concurrency and recovery. Query processing and optimization.

## Textbook

The textbook is [Database System Concepts (7th edition) by Silberschatz, Korth and Sudarshan.](https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/db-book/)

We will be following the book rather closely so it is important that you obtain a copy. It is avaialble at the NYU 
Bookstore, on Amazon and other online booksellers, and in the NYU Library.

## Grading
I plan to use the following breakdown for grading.

* 5% - In-Class Problems
* 25% - Homework
* 50% - Weekly Quizzes (starting in week 2)
* 20% - Final Exam

## In-Class Problems

I will be posting problems on Ed (see below) to be done during class.

You don't need to get these problems right, but you do need to try to do them, that is, post some answer, in order to get credit for class participation.

If you post some answer to 75% of the problems I post, you will get full
credit for that 5% of the grade.

## Homework

There will be 5 to 6 assignments. They will be made available in Ed's Lessons module.

You get 10 grace days for assignment due dates, to be used as you choose. For instance, if you turn the first assignment in 2 days late, you will have 8 days left. The graders will track this for you. After you exhaust your late days, you lose 10% for each day late.

The grace day system is designed to handle any personal situations you have, like a religious celebration, a family gathering, a short illness, a lot of work from other classes, etc.

## Quizzes and Exam

Starting in week 2, there will be weekly in-person, in-class quizzes that will take up the 20 minutes at the end of class. These will be implemented using Brightspace, the Respondus Lockdown Broswer, and Ed Lessons. You may not take these quizzes remotely. Each quiz will focus on the most recent material covered in class, typically from the week before, although

You may bring five printed or handwritten pages of notes to each quiz. You may not use any other devices other
than the computer that the Lockdown Browser is running on,

There will be 13 quizzes. Each will be worth the same amount.  I will drop the three lowest scores. So you can choose to skip up to three if you like, although I don't recommend it. However, if you skip one, it will be included in the three that are dropped. There will be no makeup quizzes except in extraordinary circumstances.

The final will be similar to the quizzes, but longer, and employing the same technologies. Like the quizzes,
it must be taken in person.

I am taking this approach in part because it is [recommended by NYU](https://teachingsupport.hosting.nyu.edu/consultations/assessment/assessment-approaches/).

## Information about Ed

Ed is an online system that will be available via Brightspace. It has discussion and lessons features that 
we will be using. It is linked from Brightspace.

The assignments, quizzes, and final will all be implemented in Ed. The lecture slides will also appear there.

## Personal Computers

It is highly recommended that you bring a laptop to class. 

## Disability Disclosure Statement
Academic accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu) for further information. Students who are requesting academic accommodations are advised to reach out to the Moses Center as early as possible in the semester for assistance, although it can be done at any time during the semester.

## Collaboration & Academic Integrity
Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It is fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask your fellow students to actually do the work for you. When you turn in an assignment, you are saying that you have done this work yourself. The definition of plagiarism is to present someone elseâ€™s work as though it were your own. Please read the Computer Science Department [statement on academic integrity](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html) for more information.
